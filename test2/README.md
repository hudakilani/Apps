# Customer Churn Prediction and Reason-for-leaving Prediction using Machine Learning

We have built a sample prototype to demonstrate how we will develop real industry level solutions. This prototype  helps to identify  about-to-withdraw customers  and act accordingly to ensure that the bank can take the best-possible course of actions. Also the prototype predicts the possible reasons of leaving for a customer which may give a better picture of customer thoughts.

The software (web-app) provides the following features: 

1. Create a *user-friendly* interface which will help DHFL with clear and easy-to-interpret visual data. 

2. Predict probability of a current customer to leave DHFL ranging from 0 to 1 
   where 0 will denote that customer will never leave DHFL and 1 will denote that customer is definitely going to leave DHFL. 
   
3.  Provide quick & on-demand data of top percentage of people likely to leave . Enables user to streamline their focus on required number of people . However choosing to predict for any customer from the data is always an option . 

4. Show all details , prediction of probability of a customer leaving DHFL along with its graph.
   Also show probability of different reasons of leaving for each customer and display easy-to-interpret pie-charts demonstrating each reason for in-depth analysis . 
This pie-chart graph shows that if probability of churn becomes true and customer really leaves, then what factors will contribute to  his/her leaving the organization, i.e. , reasons for leaving and it will show probability of each reason contributing to his/her withdrawal from services of organization.
